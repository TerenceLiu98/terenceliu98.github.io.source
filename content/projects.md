## Scientia: My Knowledgebase

> *This project, or the subdirectory, is inspired by the [Lilan's Blog](lilianweng.github.io), who is now working in OpenAI.* 

This subdirectory is documenting my learning notes and the code reproductions(if I have the time or capbability) in mainly these fields:
1. Natural Language Processing: Information Extarction and Retireval
2. Computer Vision: Object Detection, Segmentation and Synthesis
3. Optimal Transport and Generative Models
4. Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory

## Foundation of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science (MAYBE COMING SOON)

Mathematics and CS-related knowledge and technique are vitually important for someone who want to dive deeper in Machine Learning and other related Subjects, thus, I would like to build up a knowledge base in both math and cs and programing implementation with mainly `R` and `Python`.
