## Machine Learning with Us

Previously, this project is called: *Medical Image arounds Us: Deep Learning with Medical Image Processing(MIP)*

These articles are introducing the paper I read and the code I reproduce in Medical Image Analysis/Processing. **More generally, medical image processing is a subset of image processing or computer vision, or a subset in machine learning and deep learning. Therefore, I would also post some of the paper ouside the MIP but inside the ML/DL.** All the reference literatures and notes can be found in [Academic Literature](https://wiki.cklau.cc/x/CgCf)
 
1. [RetiGAN: A GAN-based model on retinal Image synthesis](/post/sci/cv-retigan-1)
2. [Style Transfer and Synthesis (1/3): Style Transfer in Image Synthesis](/post/sci/dl-gan-1)
3. [Style Transfer and Synthesis (2/3): From Decomposition to Generative Model](/post/sci/dl-gan-2) (coming soon)

## Foundation of Mathematics and Computer Science

Mathematics and CS-related knowledge and technique are vitually important for someone who want to dive deeper in Machine Learning and other related Subjects, thus, I would like to build up a knowledge base in both math and cs and programing implementation with mainly `Python` and `Mathematica`.
The reason we choose
1. Knowledge base
    1. [Mathematics](https://wiki.cklau.cc/x/fQA1)
    2. [Computer Science](https://wiki.cklau.cc/x/tQA1)
2. Correlated code: [Course We Need](https://git.cklau.cc/terenceliu/Course-We-Need)
