## Before

In the previous project: [Homelab]({{< ref "/post/tech/my-homelab-1" >}} "My Homelab 2"), I listed all my devices and VPS on a table, where all the VPS own a specific public IP, and I tried to use the Wireguard to connect them into a Full-mesh intranet.

However, to investigate deeper into the network performance, I started to learn how to federate these clusters while not affecting the current usage. What's more, if I can federate this isolated network, I don't need to build separate services in different clusters. For instance, I can use a single [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to monitor all the devices and no more millions of virtual interfaces :rofl: 


## Design

We are using the `Wireguard` to generate the virtual network interface for each node or each cluster. Between the cluster‚Äôs router, we also generate an isolated Wireguard tunnel between two nodes. Here is an example: `a1` is the router of the cluster `A` and `b` is the central router of the whole L-Net and `A`‚Äôs IP address is `172.12.1.0/24` , then we need an extra IP address(an extra Wireguard tunnel) for `a ‚Üí b`.

Under this circumstance, we can connect the nodes inside the `A (a2, a3, ‚Ä¶)`  to `b`, and other nodes  from `C (c1, c2, c3, ‚Ä¶)` can also connect to `A`.

Here is the topology of my design:

 ![topology](https://s3.cklau.cc/outline/uploads/f96d0f35-cf0a-46bd-aeca-b1a1ac9052c9/dc88ca70-d652-4d2b-9360-931c852ea1b3/LNet.drawio.png)

Those bold-colored dotted lines can be seen as the Backbone network, and the slim-colored dotted lines can be seen as the internet/intranet. The slim-black dotted line shows that cross IP range is accessible as long as the client allows the traffic.

## Configuration

### ‚ÄúBackbone Network‚Äù

As usual, I use the tool I wrote [wgtools](https://github.com/TerenceLiu98/wgtools) to generate Wireguard configuration. However, the tool is built for the full-mesh configuration, thus, for the ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù network, we need to modify the config, here is an example: in the  `sgcn`  interface, I put the following settings in `bayes`:

```bash
[Interface]
Address = 192.168.141.1/24
ListenPort = 51821
PrivateKey = <interface-prikey>

Table = off

[Peer]
# Name = cn-router
PublicKey = <peer-pubkey>
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
PersistentKeepalive = 25
Endpoint = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:51821
```

The reason why we need to set the Address of the Interface to `/24` is that if we want the subnet of `newton` are accessible, which means that `192.168.141.2/32` need to be accessible from both sides as it is the bridge between `sgcn` and `cn` as the `sgcn` the interface is the bridge between the ‚Äúexternal‚Äù to the ‚Äúinternal‚Äù. Here is the setting in `newton`:  

```bash
[Interface]
Address = 192.168.141.2/24 # the same reason, this interface is the "bridge" 
ListenPort = 51821
PrivateKey = cJgoIHnDfCl+p8D7KE0jCBkRipEwe3K6Jq7FG8OTzlo=

Table = off

[Peer]
# Name = bayes
PublicKey = FF85tV+bkTWA3rNHpn+sapA/08JV7HO92y/I1P+xsRE=
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
PersistentKeepalive = 25
Endpoint = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:51821
```

Similarly, you can modify the Address and Endpoint for `sgjp` and `sghk` .

### ‚ÄúIntranet/Internet‚Äù

It is easy to generate the configuration with my tools, or maybe you can generate them manually, which is not the key for the configuration. The important part is that for each node of the ‚Äúintranet‚Äú, you can control which other subnet can access to you. Take `gauss` and `einstein` as an example, if you want `gauss` can access from the `einstein` then you need to add the address of `einstein` in the `newton`‚Äôs `AllowedIPs`: 

```bash
# configuration of gauss
[Interface]
Address = 192.168.10.2/32,fd0b:76a0:952b:0:afa3:e03c:fe6d:2e55/128
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = <gauss-privkey>

PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

[Peer]
# Name = newton
PublicKey = <newton-pubkey>
AllowedIPs = 192.168.20.1/32,192.168.248.1/32,fd0b:76a0:952b:0:e96f:2dae:80a8:b578/128
PersistentKeepalive = 25
Endpoint = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:51820
```

This is because `newton` is the bridge between `cn` and `jp` , or more specifically, the `einstein` ‚Äòs traffic needs to go through the `jp ‚Üí sgjp ‚Üí sgcn ‚Üí cn` , and for `sgcn ‚Üí cn` you need to add the `192.168.20.1/32` in the `AllowedIPs` and `cn` will know that this traffic can be accepted by the `cn` and it‚Äôs routed via the `192.168.248.1/32`.   

### Wireguard Site-to-Site Configuration

For intuitive thinking, we need to connect cn-router, hksar-router, jp-router, with three different tunnel, however, from here I choose `OSPF(Open Shortest Path First, an Internal Gateway Protocol, or IGP)` and `iBGP(Interior Border Gateway Protocol)` to resolve the routing problem.

There are multiple different tools we can use: `bird2`, `quagga`, and etc.. I use `bird2` in here.

```bash
sudo apt-get install bird2 && sudo systemctl stop bird2
```
The reason why I stop the process at first is that I don't want the "bad" configuration to influence the network.

#### OSPF - Open Shortest Path Frist

OSPF is an interior gateway protocol (IGP) that routes packets within a single autonomous system (AS). OSPF uses link-state information to make routing decisions, making route calculations using the shortest-path-first (SPF) algorithm (also referred to as the Dijkstra algorithm). Each router running OSPF floods link-state advertisements throughout the AS or area that contain information about that router‚Äôs attached interfaces and routing metrics. Each router uses the information in these link-state advertisements to calculate the least cost path to each network and create a routing table for the protocol.

First, let's try OSPF first. 

```bash
## cn-router
router id 192.168.199.1;

protocol device {
}
protocol kernel {
    ipv4 {
        export where proto = "wg";
    };
}

protocol ospf v2 sgcn {
    ipv4 {
        import where net !~ 192.168.141.0/24;
        export all;
    };
    area 192.168.141.0 {
        interface "sgcn";
    };
}

protocol ospf v2 cn {
    ipv4 {
        export all;
    };
    area 192.168.10.0 {
        interface "cn";
    };
}
```
where `router id` is the specific id for the router, it looks like a IP address, however, it actually just arbitrary 32-bit numbers that are by convection written in dotted-quad notation. 

* `protocol deive` help use to get information about netowkr interfaces from the kernel
* `protocol kernel` performs synchronization of BIRD's routing tables with the OS kernel and here we export the `wg` protocol's routing
* `protocol ospf v2 sgcn` sets up the the OSPFv2 instance we'll use for the wireguard connection. Note that the `sgcn` is the id I give to this instance, it can be arbitrary id; we import all the routes it receives over OSPF into its routing table and `export all;`.  
  * The `import where net !~ 192.168.141.0/24;` line configures BIRD to avoid pulling in any routes to the `192.168.141.0/24` subnet from OSPF‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthis is the subnet we‚Äôre using for the WireGuard connection between `cn-router` and `sg-router`. This route is already set up in the `/etc/wireguard/sgcn.conf`.
  * The `area 192.168.141.0` block configures BIRD to use the area with an ID of `192.168.141.0` for OSPF on the specified interface. This ID is also an arbitrary 32-bit number. The `interface "sgcn"` specifies that the `sgcn` interface we set up is included in the area definition.

With this setting, the router will listen for and setd out OSPF broadcasts on the `sgcn` interface, importing the routes learned from OSPF into the table, and exporting the other routes in its table to share over OSPF. As you can se `protocol ospf v2 cn` is the OSPF for the `cn` LAN. 

```bash
# start bird
sudo systemctl start bird
# check birdc status
sudo birdc 
# reload configuration
sudo birdc configurate
# check ospf 
sudo birdc show ospf
# check route table
sudo birdc show route
```

With the above configuration, `cn-router` and `sg-router` can communicate and exchange routing table, the next step is to propagate `cn` and to `sg`'s node. We can still use `OSPF` for routing. 

![ospf routing](https://s3.cklau.cc/outline/uploads/f96d0f35-cf0a-46bd-aeca-b1a1ac9052c9/18362fae-26e4-403b-9c54-79b1fe7539e9/ospf-lnet.png)

As you can see, two LAN OSPF can sharing the local routing table to each other via the `sgcn` and `sgjp`.

#### iBGP - Interior Border Gateway Protocol

IBGP is used inside the autonomous systems. It is used to provide information to your internal routers. It requires all the devices in same autonomous systems to form full mesh topology or either of Route reflectors and Confederation for prefix learning.

```bash
# configuration of cn-router
router id 192.168.199.1;
define LOCAL_ASN = 4242420100;

protocol device {
}
protocol kernel {
    ipv4 {
        export where proto = "wg";
    };
}

protocol ospf v2 wg {
    ipv4 {
        import where net !~ 192.168.141.0/24;
        export all;
    };
    area 192.168.141.0 {
        interface "sgcn";
    };
}

protocol direct {
    ipv4;
    interface "cn";
}

protocol bgp lnet_sgcn {
    local 192.168.141.2 as 4242420100;
    neighbor 192.168.141.1 as 4242420100;
    multihop 1;
    graceful restart on;
    rr client;

    ipv4 {
        import all;
        export all;
    };
}
```

* `protocal direct` block with the actual name of the roter's LAN interface, for here, my router's LAN interface is `cn`. The `protocal direct` is required as it is used to import the direct interface routes for the LAN interface into BIRD's routing table, so that it can add the correct next hop to the routes from the other site that it will share via BGP. 
* `protocal bgp lnet` is used to define the BGP section, again, the `lnet_sgnn` is just arbitrary ID for the protocal, you can use any word/number you want. 
* `export all` directs BIRD to share all the rotes in the routing table with the other iBGP server. `next hop self` directs it to adjust those roures to make the Wireguard router itself the next hop in all those routes. This will share the rotes the Wireguard roter learned from the other site, using the Wireguard router it elf as the link to the site.
* `local 192.168.141.2 as 424220100` and `neighbor 192.168.141.1 as 424220100` is defining the AS number of local machine and the neighbor. If these two ASN are the same, we are defining a `iBGP` and if there are different we are defining a `eBGP`.

For now, I have tried `OSPF` and `iBGP`. But I just simply follow the instruction and did not dig into the high-level setting.
