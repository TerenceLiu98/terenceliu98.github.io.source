## Before

In the previous project: [Homelab]({{< ref "/post/my-homelab-1" >}} "My Homelab 2"), I listed all my devices and VPS on a table, where all the VPS own a specific public IP, and I tried to use the Wireguard to connect them into a Full-mesh intranet.

However, to investigate deeper into the network performance, I started to learn how to federate these clusters while not affecting the current usage. What's more, if I can federate this isolated network, I don't need to build separate services in different clusters. For instance, I can use a single [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to monitor all the devices and no more millions of virtual interfaces :rofl: 


## Design

We are using the `Wireguard` to generate the virtual network interface for each node or each cluster. Between the cluster‚Äôs router, we also generate an isolated Wireguard tunnel between two nodes. Here is an example: `a1` is the router of the cluster `A` and `b` is the central router of the whole L-Net and `A`‚Äôs IP address is `172.12.1.0/24` , then we need an extra IP address(an extra Wireguard tunnel) for `a ‚Üí b`.

Under this circumstance, we can connect the nodes inside the `A (a2, a3, ‚Ä¶)`  to `b`, and other nodes  from `C (c1, c2, c3, ‚Ä¶)` can also connect to `A`.

Here is the topology of my design:

Those bold-colored dotted lines can be seen as the Backbone network, and the slim-colored dotted lines can be seen as the internet/intranet. The slim-black dotted line shows that cross IP range is accessible as long as the client allows the traffic.
